Using/VBG prepared/JJ statements/NNS just/RB so/IN you/PRP can/MD use/VB parameterised/JJ queries/NNS is/VBZ incredibly/RB dumb/JJ from/IN a/DT performance/NN point/NN of/IN view/NN ;/: any/DT app/NN that/WDT 's/VBZ repeatedly/RB issuing/VBG the/DT same/JJ query/NN clearly/RB has/VBZ problems/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN PHP/NNP where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ no/DT continuity/NN between/IN requests/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- i.e./FW time/NN spent/VBN in/IN prepare/VB is/VBZ nearly/RB always/RB time/NN wasted/VBN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
