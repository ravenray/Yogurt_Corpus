Multiple/JJ methods/NNS can/MD be/VB combined/VBN successfully/RB ,/, but/CC good/JJ taste/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB in/IN order/NN ./.
Password/NN complexity/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, anything/NN password-based/JJ critically/RB depends/VBZ on/IN passwords/NNS having/VBG sufficient/JJ entropy/NN ./.
IMHO/NNP ,/, a/DT strong/JJ password/NN written/VBN down/RP in/IN a/DT secure/JJ physical/JJ location/NN is/VBZ better/JJR than/IN a/DT weak/JJ password/NN in/IN memory/NN ./.
People/NNS know/VBP how/WRB to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT security/NN of/IN paper/NN documents/NNS much/RB better/JJR than/IN they/PRP know/VBP how/WRB to/TO figure/VB the/DT effective/JJ entropy/NN in/IN their/PRP$ dog/NN 's/POS name/NN when/WRB used/VBN as/IN a/DT password/NN for/IN three/CD different/JJ websites/NNS ./.

As/IN you/PRP noted/VBD ,/, throttling/VBG back/RB failed/VBN login/NN attempts/NNS is/VBZ a/DT trade-off/NN between/IN preventing/VBG brute-force/JJ attacks/NNS and/CC ease/NN of/IN DoSing/NN an/DT account/NN ./.

Like/IN you/PRP said/VBD ,/, hardware/NN tokens/NNS in/IN the/DT ``/`` something/NN you/PRP have/VBP ''/'' are/VBP great/JJ ,/, but/CC many/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- not/RB all/DT -RRB-/-RRB- have/VBP real/JJ admin/JJ overhead/NN associated/VBN with/IN their/PRP$ distribution/NN ./.
