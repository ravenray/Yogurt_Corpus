The/DT whole/JJ point/NN in/IN salting/VBG is/VBZ to/TO prevent/VB you/PRP from/IN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT hashed/VBN password/NN and/CC see/VBP that/IN multiple/JJ users/NNS have/VBP the/DT same/JJ hash/NN -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC thus/RB the/DT same/JJ password/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
Without/IN salting/VBG you/PRP could/MD just/RB use/VB the/DT hashing/VBG algorithm/NN and/CC generate/VB every/DT possible/JJ hash/NN and/CC then/RB do/VB a/DT brute/JJ search/NN for/IN that/DT hash/NN ./.
Since/IN the/DT algorithm/NN never/RB changes/VBZ it/PRP makes/VBZ it/PRP predictable/JJ for/IN attackers/NNS ,/, salting/VBG just/RB makes/VBZ it/PRP that/IN much/RB more/RBR difficult/JJ ./.
Yes/UH but/CC if/IN you/PRP use/VBP a/DT complicated/JJ enough/RB hashing/VBG algorithm/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ pseudo/JJ random/JJ salt/NN then/RB you/PRP can/MD push/VB the/DT complexity/NN of/IN solving/VBG the/DT problem/NN into/IN the/DT realms/NNS of/IN physical/JJ impossibility/NN on/IN any/DT modern/future/JJ hardware/NN ./.
2/CD ^/SYM 128/CD is/VBZ a/DT really/RB big/JJ number/NN !/.
I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB realize/VB you/PRP were/VBD assuming/VBG the/DT salt/NN had/VBD been/VBN compromised/VBN as/RB well/RB ./.
Whilst/IN technically/RB you/PRP are/VBP correct/JJ the/DT real/JJ issue/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT hacker/NN has/VBZ compromised/VBN the/DT entire/JJ database/NN before/IN we/PRP begin/VBP ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT much/RB larger/JJR issue/NN than/IN the/DT fact/NN he/PRP can/MD crack/VB common/JJ passwords/NNS in/IN 3/CD days/NNS ;-RRB-/EMO Salting/VBG is/VBZ not/RB meant/VBN to/TO prevent/VB what/WP you/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ,/, but/CC instead/RB to/TO prevent/VB the/DT hacker/NN from/IN gaining/VBG access/NN to/TO every/DT password/NN in/IN your/PRP$ database/NN in/IN one/CD go/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ -/: as/IN is/VBZ every/DT form/NN of/IN encryption/NN -/: merely/RB a/DT method/NN to/TO INCONVENIENCE/VB the/DT attacker/NN @erickson/ATS key/JJ stengthening/NN is/VBZ another/DT good/JJ point/NN ./.
