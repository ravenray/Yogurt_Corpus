For/IN example/NN ,/, collision/NN resistance/NN implies/VBZ second/JJ preimage/NN resistance/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB the/DT other/JJ way/NN around/IN ./.
For/IN any/DT given/VBN application/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD have/VB different/JJ requirements/NNS ,/, needing/VBG one/CD or/CC more/JJR of/IN these/DT properties/NNS ./.
A/DT hash/JJ function/NN for/IN securing/VBG passwords/NNS on/IN a/DT server/NN will/MD usually/RB only/RB require/VB preimage/NN resistance/NN ,/, while/IN message/NN digests/NNS require/VBP all/DT three/CD ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN that/IN MD5/ACR is/VBZ not/RB collision/NN resistant/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB preclude/VB its/PRP$ use/NN in/IN applications/NNS that/WDT do/VBP not/RB require/VB collision/NN resistance/NN ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, MD5/ACR is/VBZ often/RB still/RB used/VBN in/IN applications/NNS where/WRB the/DT smaller/JJR key/JJ size/NN and/CC speed/NN are/VBP beneficial/JJ ./.
That/DT said/VBD ,/, due/JJ to/TO its/PRP$ flaws/NNS ,/, researchers/NNS recommend/VBP the/DT use/NN of/IN other/JJ hash/JJ functions/NNS in/IN new/JJ scenarios/NNS ./.
SHA1/ACR has/VBZ a/DT flaw/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ collisions/NNS to/TO be/VB found/VBN in/IN theoretically/RB far/RB less/JJR than/IN the/DT 2/CD ^/SYM 80/CD steps/NNS a/DT secure/JJ hash/JJ function/NN of/IN its/PRP$ length/NN would/MD require/VB ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN NIST/ACR is/VBZ phasing/VBG out/RP the/DT use/NN of/IN SHA1/ACR ,/, stating/VBG that/IN the/DT SHA2/ACR family/NN should/MD be/VB used/VBN after/IN 2010/CD ./.

For/IN that/DT reason/NN alone/RB I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN SHA/ACR functions/NNS over/IN it/PRP ./.
In/IN the/DT implementation/NN you/PRP are/VBP using/VBG it/PRP seems/VBZ quite/RB slow/JJ as/IN well/RB ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP less/RBR useful/JJ ./.
In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT one/CD best/JJS function/NN -/: it/PRP all/DT depends/VBZ on/IN what/WP you/PRP need/VBP it/PRP for/IN ./.
