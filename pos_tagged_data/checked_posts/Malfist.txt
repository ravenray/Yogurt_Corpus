In/IN PHP/ACR ,/, you/PRP can/MD use/VB the/DT mcrypt/COS or/CC bcrypt/COS libraries/NNS for/IN better/JJR encryption/NN than/IN md5/ACR or/CC sha1/ACR ./.

This/DT keeps/VBZ the/DT entropy/NN the/DT same/JJ ,/, but/CC increases/VBZ the/DT time/NN to/TO compute/VB the/DT hash/NN ./.
@Tom/ATS Gullen/ATS ,/, what/WDT articles/NNS are/VBP you/PRP reading/VBG ?/.
Self-professed/JJ experts/NNS or/CC peer/VB reviewed/VBN articles/NNS in/IN a/DT scientific/JJ journal/NN ?/.

Security/NN is/VBZ n't/RB something/NN you/PRP can/MD pick/VB up/RP on/IN the/DT side/NN ,/, it/PRP requires/VBZ extensive/JJ knowledge/NN ./.
