Yogurt Corpus Information:

The Yogurt Corpus is a collection of questions and answerers pulled from the  
popular website, Stackoverflow.com. All of these posts were found by searching  
for the word "vulnerability."  This word covers a variety of different  
languages, such as PHP and C. 
 
The posts are all structured using the TEI XML formatting. The majority of the  
formatting was adopted from the paper "A TEI Schema for the Represenation of  
Computer-mediated Communication" by Michael Beisswenger, Maria Ermakva,  
Alexander Geyken, Lothar Lemnitzer, and Angelika Storrer (2012).  The one  
element not found in this paper is the use of the front tag to hold the count  
for the number of up or down votes for a particular post. User's reputations can be found under the TEI header.  

Div Types:
Up vote: the number of up votes a post has received.  
Down vote: the number of down votes a post has received OR if the word favorite 
appears in the text, it is the number of people who have marked this post as  
their favorite. If no number next to the word favorite, only one person has  
marked that post.
